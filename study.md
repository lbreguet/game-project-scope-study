## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
- The wireframe will be at the bottom of the page.

-   The data structure you plan to use.
- One html page, a couple of css pages if I plan to use sass or not, Ajax to
  manipulate the web page, and multiple pages of javascript to display my game
  and create curl requests.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
- I guess the Tic Tac Toe markup is similar to the boggle challenge, because we
  will be looking at a 3 x 3 board. Of course the code will be different, but I
  believe the direction is the same.

-   How you plan to approach this project.
- After creating a readable wireframe I will start will the html to get the
  page in order, then the css to get the styling, then I'll focus on the Ajax
  and the javascript.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
- I'm a user who wants to beat others at Tic Tac Toe.
- I'm a user who wants to see the code that makes up a simple game.
- I'm a user who wants to know how to host multiplayer servers.
- I'm a user who likes to play games from time to time.

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
- Depending on how comfortable I get with using Sass, I will be using normal css
  to style my page. With Javscript, I'll have more freedom and keep seperate
  code themes in their respective file. The use of `require()` will be extremely
  important here.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
- Lately I have had an interest with Final Fantasy. I might just add some FF
  styling to spruce up the page.

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
- I will make frequent git commits to keep track of where I am and what I need
  to do. With version control I can see what mistakes I have made and what needs
  to be changed.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
- Haha, first I have to get the project done.
